## 📈 Model Interpretability

### Feature Impact Analysis

The Random Forest feature importance analysis revealed:
- **Humidity**: Accounts for ~30% of predictive power
- **Pressure**: Strong negative correlation with rainfall probability
- **Cloud Cover**: Direct positive relationship with precipitation
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Summer/winter variations significantly impact predictions

### Business Rules Derived

From the model insights, practical rules emerge:
- High humidity (>70%) + Low pressure (<1010 hPa) = High rain probability
- Clear skies (cloud cover <3/8) = Very low rain probability
- Seasonal adjustments needed for accurate predictions
